Crimson Forge
=============

Crimson Forge intends to provide sustainable evasion capabilities for native
code on the x86 and AMD64 architectures. It achieves this by rewriting the input
code utilizing the following two techniques:

**Shuffling:** Instructions are shuffled into a new order at the basic block
level. This is a reliable technique and does not modify the size of resulting
binary.

**Alterations:** Instructions are swapped with functional equivalents,
effectively de-optimizing them. New instructions are inserted into the same
graph used by the Shuffling technique, allowing them to be reordered as well.

Due to the nature of the re-writing, it is not necessary for processed shellcode
to exist within writeable memory. This eliminates a very common pattern which is
identified as malicious by many AV and EDR systems.

Installation
------------

See the `INSTALL.md <INSTALL.md>`__ for installation instructions.

Getting Started
---------------

Once installed, utilize the primary command line interface at
``./crimson-forge``. The help menu documents each of the options. Basic usage
includes specifying an architecture (e.g. ``amd64`` or ``x86``), providing an
input file, and specifying an output file. By default both the input and output
files are expected to be raw shellcode, not executable files such EXEs. Use the
``--format`` and ``--output-format`` options to specify the input and output
data formats respectively. Note that the ``--output-format`` option can be
specified multiple times. Additionally, arguments can be defined in a file one
per line and passed using the syntax ``./crimson-forge @file/with/args.txt``.
See `data/common-arguments.txt <data/common-arguments.txt>`__ as an example.

Known Limitations
-----------------

**Unstaged Payloads:** Unstaged payloads as generated by the Metasploit
Framework are currently not functional due to the constraints on the file
format.

**Tainted References:** Certain payloads retrieve references to their location
in memory and then apply a static offset to it. Crimson Forge has no way to
identify the significance of the static offset which will change when
*Alterations* are applied. Crimson Forge will attempt to identify instances
where this occurs and will disable *Alterations* altogether to ensure a
functional output is produced. However, disabling *Alterations* limits the
capabilities to generate unique binaries.

**Encoded Payloads:** All encoding modules within the Metasploit Framework
require the shellcode to be placed in memory with Read, Write and Execute (RWX)
permissions. This defeats the purpose of Crimson Forge. See also *Tainted
References*. 

Technical Documentation
-----------------------

The existing technical documentation of the internal API is able to be built
with Sphinx. Build the documentation with the following command:

Welcome to Crimson Forge's documentation!
=========================================
This project aims to provide a sustainable technique for bypassing Anti Virus
applications. The primary way it accomplishes this is a combination of rewriting
native code at the assembly level withing requiring that it modifies itself.
The primary application (`crimson-forge`) applies this technique to code
provided by the user and generates a randomized output with the intention that
it will not be identified by signature based detections.

The source code is available on the `GitHub homepage`_.
